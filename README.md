play with random numbers and strings

Write a Java program named RandomStrings.java that does the following:

for a grade of C: 
  - read in an integer and use this to seed your random number generator (see this example: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-setseed-method-in-java-with-examples/)
  - read in a string
  - pick a random number between 0 and the length of the string-1
  - output a new string that removes the letter at the random number
  - for example if the string is HELLO JOHN and the random number is 3, output HELO JOHN
  - another example if string is GOODBYE SALLY and the random number is 0, output OODBYE SALLY
  - if string is GOODBYE SALLY and the random number is 12, output GOODBYE SALL
  
for a grade of B: 
  - read a string
  - pick 2 random numbers between 0 and the length of the string-1
  - output a new string which exchanges the characters at the 2 random positions
  - for example if the string is HELLO JOHN and the random numbers are 2 and 5, output HE LOLJOHN
  - if string is HELLO JOHN and the number numbers are 6 and 1, output
